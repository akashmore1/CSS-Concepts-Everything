# GRID

## Default Behaviour

1. We can apply **display: grid;** to container so we can use grid properties
2. When we apply **display: grid;** to container, default behaviour is, container will have 1 column and other children as all rows.
3. Only direct children of grid container will be grid items.(Just like flex)
